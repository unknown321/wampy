Angry about... XDA
==================

Usually XDA forums is the first Google link when you search for anything related to tinkering with phones.

XDA is not a resource, it is a forum with all problems of a regular forum, including:

- impossible to find information
- karma
- no content quality check

I've visited XDA on different occasions trying to find information on different devices, such as Sony phones, Samsung
tablets, MediaTek tooling, Qualcomm platforms. And every time I failed.

### Basics

Let's try to figure out how Sony Xperia S boots by googling `site:xdaforums.com how does sony xperia s boot`. First four
threads are about bricked phones, fifth looks like a guide for
starters: https://xdaforums.com/t/xperia-s-info-ref-all-that-u-need-to-know-before-u-begin.1526866/

We are immediately introduced to 3 bootmodes, one of them is regular one and two others are for flashing, but one is an
official way of flashing and other isâ€¦ unofficial? Then there is some blabber about booting into those modes, basebands,
fastboot drivers... Basically this guide throws random words at you without getting into details. After 4 or 5 posts
like that it all comes together into "hold buttons, swipe to flash and pray".

Perhaps XDA back in 2012 was a different place. What about more recent guides?

### Modern basics

February
2023, https://xdaforums.com/t/how-to-enable-volte-and-5g-without-permanent-root-on-xperia-5-iii-and-1-iii.4551847/

Nope, just like 2012, random program names are thrown at you. Install this exe, run it like this, next step. Now this
apk, don't ask what does it do, just execute orders.

First reply? `Amazing detailed guide. Thanks for sharing.`

### Asking easier questions

All right, maybe stuff like this IS complicated and explaining everything in one guide will take pages of text. Let's
ask something else, which should have a definitive answer. How about scatter file? From what I've gathered, this a file
with partition info used with various flashing tools, so you could flash only one partition instead of overwriting whole
memory device.

Here is the example:

Okay, but what exactly it is? Is there some doc describing the format?
Google: `site:xdaforums.com what is scatter file`.

Google responds with 9 links of questions about getting the file,
and [one (first one! could it be it?)](https://xdaforums.com/t/is-a-scatter-file-needed-for-building-a-custom-rom.4687546/)
that says right there:

> Scatter files are just used to point to the directories of images.

This is a post by `Forum Moderator` and `Staff member` named `fl0w` (1184 reactions score and 25026 XP points, sound
very reputable, right?) from 22 Aug 2024. As we can clearly see from MT8163 example, scatter file is much more than
simple `<partition:image file>` map file. This `Staff member` is either wrong or omitting a bunch of details.

Another search (`scatter file syntax`), another page of questions and step-by-step guides without answers. Is it me
asking wrong questions or there is no answer available online? By the way, there is no search form for unregistered
users, you have to join the community.

#### Why?

Why bother with scatter file details? NW-A50 is a MediaTek device, but regular tools (MTK Droid Tools, SP Flash Tool,
something else?) failed to dump partitions for reasons, asking for scatter
file. [mtkclient](https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient) just works without any files, dumping whole ROM, but:

- some commands fail
- it takes ~20 minutes to fully reflash 16GB, when only one partition needs a reflash

So I decided to take a look into scatter files and here we are - not a lot of knowledge gained from

<details>
<summary>So what is it?</summary>

This is a file with a list of device partitions with following instructions:

- source file that will be used during flash
- name
- physical/logical addresses
- region in memory (?)
- and other options I have no idea about, like `is_reserved`

(That's right, I failed to gather a detailed answer from crops on the internet)

Partition table might be available in `/proc/mtd`, `/proc/emmc`, kernel source.

With these you *probably* can make a scatter file and feed it to tools, but I settled on `mtkclient`. There is also
a shortcut I discovered - you can flash ~10% (about 1GB) of previously dumped firmware to overwrite partitions that
matter and pull the cable out. Device *usually* boots fine.

Note that `bx8590m1_emmc` is not the same platform as actual device. According to `/proc/config.gz`, platform
is `BBDMP5_linux` (`CONFIG_ARCH_MTK_PROJECT`), but there are no partition definitions there. I suppose partitions
are taken from some other platform, but kernel sources are kinda hard to navigate, so I chose `bx8590m1_emmc` as an
example.

Just so you know, these are NOT cherry-picked threads to make people look bad, I literally used at least somewhat
relevant links on first page of Google Search.

I assume that there are two main categories of users on XDA.

- First, there is a newbie user, who wants to flash his phone (or already bricked it). He asks innocent questions, gets
  "this is a duplicate question, topic closed" from Senior Moderator, posts in another thread and gets banned - you
  know,
  regular forum experience.

- Second, power users. These have titles, lots of "experience points" (what is this), stars in their profiles and
  thousands of messages. They are the guys who throw random words at you, like Magisk, Shizuku, ODIN, LAHAINA, IMS, TWRP
  and others.

There is no "diving into details and telling others" user between them. No one makes guides explaining **what** every
step does, it's only **how to execute** that step. That makes sense, because newbies are not interested in details, all
they need is a shiny new firmware (camera doesn't work, 2G only) on their $40 phone. I am pretty sure that most of the
power users are not aware of inner workings of tools they use. It's just "unpack firmware with X.exe, do Y, try Z.exe if
X.exe fails" knowledge.

There is also a third group, which makes a couple of posts linking to their new shiny opensource tools replacing that
old garbage power users used to work with. These are the guys who usually know what are they doing and not afraid to
share their knowledge with others. GitHub issues for that project becomes a part of XDA with "please help
bricked" issues. Sooner or later author stops communicating, because hell is other people.
A great (and sad) example: https://github.com/phhusson/treble_experimentations

### Summary

In my opinion, XDA is not a place where you can learn technical knowledge and understand how your device works. This is
a place where step-by-step guides are born and bricked phones rest.
